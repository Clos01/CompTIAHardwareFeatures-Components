## BIOS and POST

- **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** is firmware built into the motherboard, responsible for starting the computer and running initial hardware checks (POST).
- **POST (Power-On Self Test)** is part of the BIOS that ensures all hardware components function correctly before the system boots the operating system.

## CMOS and Connectors

- **CMOS** stores important system settings such as date, time, and hardware configurations. It requires a battery to retain information when the computer is off.
- **Back-Panel Connectors** are located at the back of the system and connect external peripherals like monitors, keyboards, and network devices.
- **Front-Panel Connectors** provide easy access to ports for USB devices, audio jacks, and power/reset buttons.

## Processors

- **Processors (CPU)** are made of silicon chips with millions of transistors. Major manufacturers include **Intel** and **AMD**.
- **PGA (Pin Grid Array)** and **LGA (Land Grid Array)** are the two types of CPU sockets. PGA has pins on the processor, while LGA has pins on the motherboard.
- Heat management for processors is crucial, using components like **heat sinks** and **fans** to prevent overheating.

## Expansion Slots

- **Expansion Slots** allow for additional hardware such as video cards, network cards, and sound cards.
- **PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)** and **AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port)** are older slot types.
- **PCIe (PCI Express)** is the current standard, offering faster data transfer rates.

## Disk Controllers

- **Disk Controllers** manage the connection between the motherboard and the hard drive, allowing data to be stored and retrieved.
- **IDE (PATA)** is an older standard using large ribbon cables, while **SATA (Serial ATA)** is a newer, faster standard using smaller, more efficient cables.
